A novel framework combining **3D Morphable Model (3DMM)** with a **Diffusion-based Transformer** to address challenges in audio-driven talking head generation.
  
---

## üî• Overview

**MoDiT** is a framework designed to generate realistic and consistent talking heads from audio and a single image. It addresses the following challenges:

- **Temporal jittering**: Weak temporal constraints causing frame inconsistencies.
- **Identity drift**: Insufficient 3D information leading to poor facial identity preservation.
- **Unnatural blinking**: Inadequate modeling of realistic blink dynamics.

### üöÄ Key Contributions

1. **Hierarchical denoising strategy**:
   - Revised temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms.
   - Improved lip synchronization and full-face coherence.
   
2. **Integration of 3DMM coefficients**:
   - Explicit spatial constraints for accurate 3D-informed optical flow prediction.
   - Enhanced identity consistency and lip synchronization.

3. **Refined blinking strategy**:
   - Modeled natural eye movements, resulting in smoother, more realistic blinking behavior.

## üìÑ Abstract

Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as virtual assistants, video games, and films. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both consistent and realistic facial animations.  
To address these issues, **MoDiT** introduces a novel framework that combines the **3D Morphable Model (3DMM)** with a **Diffusion-based Transformer**, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
